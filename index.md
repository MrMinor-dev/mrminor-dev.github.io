## About

I build AI-native systems that transform session-based AI into autonomous business operations. Currently operating **MRMINOR LLC**, where I design and implement production automation frameworks managing a real e-commerce business with 40 minutes of daily oversight.

This portfolio showcases the production-tested frameworks and systems I've built, demonstrating practical applications of AI orchestration, document automation, and operational excellence.

**Focus Areas:**
- AI Session Orchestration
- Autonomous Decision Systems
- Document Automation & Intelligence
- Quality Assurance Frameworks
- Operational Process Automation

## Production AI Systems

These frameworks are extracted from real business operations, sanitized for public sharing. They're not toy projects - they manage live business operations daily.

### 🤖 [AI Session Orchestration Framework](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/ai-session-orchestration)

**The Challenge:** Session-based AI (like Claude or GPT-4) has no memory between conversations, making continuous business operations impossible with traditional approaches.

**The Solution:** Three-layer architecture combining true automation (runs 24/7 without AI), document-based state persistence (context across sessions), and progressive autonomy (AI makes increasingly complex decisions).

**The Impact:** Transforms 40 minutes of daily AI interaction into 24/7 autonomous business operations.

**Key Innovations:**
- Progressive autonomy model (Level 1 → 5 decision authority)
- Context restoration in <5 minutes between sessions
- Zero context loss through incremental state updates
- Hybrid markdown + XML enabling machine-readable business rules

**Real Metrics (3 months production use):**
- 80% time reduction: 3.5 hours/day → 40 minutes/day
- 87% Level 1 autonomy (AI executes without asking)
- 82% Level 2 acceptance (proposals approved first time)
- 99.9% uptime with 24/7 operations
- 225x ROI on AI subscription cost

**Tech Stack:** Claude API, n8n, Python, markdown, XML, Google Drive

### 📚 [Document Autonomy System](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/document-autonomy-system) *(Coming Soon)*

**The Challenge:** Documentation that enables both human understanding and AI automation without requiring two separate systems.

**The Solution:** Hybrid format combining markdown (human-readable narrative) with XML (machine-queryable data structures) in a single document.

**Key Innovations:**
- Decision matrices with programmatic thresholds
- Risk assessment scoring with trigger conditions
- Escalation protocols tied to specific events
- Bidirectional cross-references between documents
- Version-controlled business rules

**Use Cases:**
- AI queries documents to make autonomous decisions
- Humans read same documents for strategic understanding
- Automated validation of decision compliance
- Progressive complexity (start simple, add XML as needed)

**Tech Stack:** Markdown, XML, Python validation scripts, Git version control

---

### 📁 [Automated File Management](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/automated-file-management) *(Coming Soon)*

**The Challenge:** Maintaining consistent file operations across cloud storage with zero errors, automatic indexing, and intelligent cross-referencing.

**The Solution:** Automated protocols that validate every file operation, maintain searchable indexes, and enforce naming conventions.

**Key Innovations:**
- Auto-updating file index on every create/move/delete operation
- Kebab-case naming convention enforcement
- Cross-platform path validation (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Automated backup verification
- Bidirectional document cross-references

**Real Impact:**
- Zero file loss incidents across 1,000+ operations
- <5 seconds to locate any file via index search
- Eliminated naming inconsistencies
- Seamless multi-device synchronization

**Tech Stack:** Python, Git, filesystem APIs, cloud storage integration

---

### ✅ [Quality Assurance Framework](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/qa-framework) *(Coming Soon)*

**The Challenge:** Preventing errors in AI-generated content and automated workflows while maintaining high velocity.

**The Solution:** 8-step pre-flight validation system with content scoring, automated compliance checking, and error pattern detection.

**Key Innovations:**
- Multi-tier audit schedules (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly)
- Content quality scoring algorithm
- Automated FTC/platform policy compliance checks
- Error pattern detection and root cause analysis
- Zero-tolerance approach for critical issues

**Real Metrics:**
- 0 compliance violations detected in production
- 95%+ content quality scores
- 90% error prevention (caught before publication)
- 5-minute pre-flight checks vs. hours of reactive fixes

**Tech Stack:** n8n workflows, Claude API, Python validation scripts

---

### 🔄 [Incremental Update Protocol](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/incremental-update-protocol) *(Coming Soon)*

**The Challenge:** Long AI sessions hit token limits, causing context loss and wasted work when sessions crash unexpectedly.

**The Solution:** Automatic state checkpoints every 30 minutes with token monitoring, preventing loss of more than 30 minutes of work.

**Key Innovations:**
- Token usage monitoring (70%/85%/95% thresholds with color alerts)
- Automatic breakpoint detection at logical stopping points
- Graceful session handoff even during crashes
- Conversation search integration for gap recovery
- Never lose more than 30 minutes of work

**Real Impact:**
- 0 sessions lost to token limits in 3 months
- 100% successful session handoffs
- Average continuation time: <2 minutes
- Eliminated frustration from crashed sessions

**Tech Stack:** Python monitoring, markdown state files, token counting algorithms
