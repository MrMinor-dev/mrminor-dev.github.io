## About

I build AI-native systems that transform session-based AI into autonomous business operations. Currently operating **MRMINOR LLC**, where I design and implement production automation frameworks managing a real e-commerce business with 40 minutes of daily oversight.

This portfolio showcases the production-tested frameworks and systems I've built, demonstrating practical applications of AI orchestration, document automation, and operational excellence.

**Focus Areas:**
- AI Session Orchestration
- Autonomous Decision Systems
- Document Automation & Intelligence
- Quality Assurance Frameworks
- Operational Process Automation

## Production AI Systems

These frameworks are extracted from real business operations, sanitized for public sharing. They're not toy projects - they manage live business operations daily.

### 🤖 [AI Session Orchestration Framework](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/ai-session-orchestration)

**Challenge:** Session-based AI has no memory between conversations  
**Solution:** Three-layer architecture (automation + document state + agentic sessions)  
**Impact:** 24/7 business operations from 40 min/day human time

**Key Innovations:**
- Progressive autonomy model (Level 1→5)
- Context restoration <5 minutes
- Zero context loss between sessions
- Hybrid markdown + XML for machine-readable business rules

**Tech Stack:** Claude API, n8n, markdown, XML, Google Drive

---

### 📚 [Document Autonomy System](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/document-autonomy-system) *(Coming Soon)*

**Challenge:** Documentation that enables both human understanding and AI automation  
**Solution:** Hybrid format combining markdown (human-readable) + XML (machine-queryable)

**Key Innovations:**
- Decision matrices with programmatic thresholds
- Risk assessment scoring
- Escalation protocols with trigger conditions
- Bidirectional cross-references

**Tech Stack:** Markdown, XML, Python validation scripts

---

### 📁 [Automated File Management](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/automated-file-management) *(Coming Soon)*

**Challenge:** Consistent file operations across platforms with zero errors  
**Solution:** Automated indexing, validation, and cross-referencing protocols

**Key Innovations:**
- Auto-updating file index on every operation
- Kebab-case naming convention enforcement
- Cross-platform path validation
- Automated backup verification

**Tech Stack:** Python, Git, filesystem APIs

---

### ✅ [Quality Assurance Framework](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/qa-framework) *(Coming Soon)*

**Challenge:** Preventing errors in AI-generated content and automated workflows  
**Solution:** 8-step pre-flight validation system with zero-tolerance approach

**Key Innovations:**
- Content quality scoring
- Automated compliance checking
- Multi-tier audit schedules
- Error pattern detection

**Tech Stack:** n8n workflows, Claude API, validation scripts

---

### 🔄 [Incremental Update Protocol](https://github.com/MrMinor-dev/incremental-update-protocol) *(Coming Soon)*

**Challenge:** Context loss in long-running AI sessions due to token limits  
**Solution:** Automatic state updates every 30 minutes, preventing data loss

**Key Innovations:**
- Token usage monitoring (70%/85%/95% thresholds)
- Automatic breakpoint detection
- Graceful session handoff
- Never lose >30 minutes of work

**Tech Stack:** Python monitoring, markdown state files

---

## Design Philosophy

**1. Production-First**
- Systems built for real operations, not demos
- Patterns designed for enterprise scale
- Battle-tested through daily use

**2. Documentation-Driven**
- Human-readable AND machine-queryable
- Self-documenting systems
- Clear decision authority

**3. Progressive Autonomy**
- Start with human-in-loop
- Gradually increase AI authority
- Measurable trust building

**4. Graceful Failure**
- Systems work even when AI unavailable
- Clear escalation protocols
- Automated error recovery

---

## Metrics

**AI Session Orchestration (3 months production):**
- Context restoration: <5 minutes
- Level 1 autonomy: 85% execution rate
- Level 2 proposals: 78% acceptance rate
- Strategic surprises: 0 (100% proactive)
- Uptime: 99.9% (24/7 operations)

**Business Impact:**
- $147.99/month budget → Full business automation
- 40 min/day → 24/7 operations
- 10x decision speed improvement
- Scales from 1 to N businesses
